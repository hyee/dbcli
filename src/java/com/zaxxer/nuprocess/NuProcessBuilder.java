/**
 * This class is used to create operating system processes.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code NuProcessBuilder} instance manages a collection of process
 * attributes. The {@link #start()} method creates a new {@link NuProcess}
 * instance with those attributes. The {@link #start()} method can be invoked
 * repeatedly from the same instance to create new subprocesses with identical
 * or related attributes.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code NuProcessBuilder} manages these attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a <em>command</em>, a list of strings which signifies the external
 * program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any. Which string lists
 * represent a valid operating system command is system-dependent. For example,
 * it is common for each conceptual argument to be an element in this list, but
 * there are operating systems where programs are expected to tokenize command
 * line strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
 * require commands to contain exactly two elements.</li>
 *
 * <li>an <em>environment</em>, which is a system-dependent mapping from
 * variables to values. The initial value is a copy of the environment of the
 * current process. See {@link System#getenv()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes subsequently
 * started by that object's {@link #start()} method, but will never affect
 * previously started processes or the Java process itself.
