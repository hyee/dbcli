/**
 * Executors of a {@link NuProcess} must provide an implementation of this class
 * to the {@link ProcessBuilder} prior to calling {@link ProcessBuilder#start()}
 * . This interface provides the primary means of asynchronous interaction
 * between the running child process and your code.
 * <p>
 * Methods specified by this interface will be invoked by the asynchronous
 * processing thread. It is up to the implementation of this interface to handle
 * the resulting state changes or process the data passed to it.
 * <p>
 * Note that the processing thread that executes these callbacks on behalf of a
 * NuProcess is the same thread that handles processing for other instances of
 * NuProcess, and as a result you should never perform a blocking or
 * time-consuming operation on the callback thread. Doing so will block or
 * severely hinder the processing of other NuProcess instances. Any operation
 * that requires more than single-digit millisecond processing should be handed
 * off to another thread so that the processing thread can return to immediately
 * service other NuProcess instances.
