Description
-----------------------

DBCLI is a portable database command line utility, for DBA or application support to easily manage and run their common used scripts, similar to database built-in CLI tools but is more flexible.  

It is mainly developed by Lua language, and bridges to JDBC to access database, many of the files are SQL scripts that easy to maintain.<br/> 
It is designed to support multiple databases, and includes 2 types of modules, one is the public module whose functions are visible across all database platforms, 
and another one is the platform-specific module.


It is not intended to support all features of the existing CLI utilities that embedded by the specific database(`Oracle SQL*Plus`, `DB2 CLP`, etc), but to provide the features other than those tools:

* Pretty-print of the select statement and the flexible control of the grid layouts(see set command)
* Automatically generate help documents for customized SQL/shell/etc scripts.
* The `alias` command to reduce the frequent inputs
* The powerful `snap` and `ora` commands as the replacement of the standard CLI scripts, so that DBA is able to quickly define and execute the SQL templates with the smallest input
* Support SSH operations
* Provides the graph charts of the database performance, refer to the "chart" command
* Easy to extend, modify or deploy, because most of the source code is not required to compile
* Easily switch to the db built-in cli utility


Download
-----------------------
DBCLI does not require compile or installation, but depends on JRE 1.8+. Click `Download ZIP`,extract and use. Or you can also download from the published releases<br/> 
Branch `With-JRE` contains the shrinked JRE bundle, if you don't have JRE installed,
you may switch to that branch to download. Due to the region and charset differences, this JRE bundle is not guaranteed to work well.<br/>

### Windows: Configure terminal window
For Windows OS, to avoid the word wrap in the terminal window which affects the print layout, following settings are recommended in Windows command window:

* In the `Layout` tab, set buffer width and buffer height as `500+`
* In the `Font` tab, change the font size as smaller value.

### Linux: Pre-Requisitions
Linux must be the `64-bit` version, and make sure `glibc >= v2.4`(use `ldd --version` to verify) are installed. You can use command `<command> | more` to vertically/horizontally scroll the command output, or `more last` or scroll the last command output. 

### OSX: Pre-Requisitions
Only tested on OSX 10.12, lower version should be fine. Java 1.8 is required. It's recommended to add entry `<hostname>.local` into `/etc/hosts` to speed up the JVM performance.
For Example:
```
127.0.0.1  localhost mac-pc.local
::1        localhost mac-pc.local
```


### Configure environment
Before running dbcli, make sure that you have installed JRE 1.8+ in your local PC. If you are using the version of "With-JRE" branch, this step can be skipped.

Create file `init.cfg` under the "data" directory with following content(for non-Windows OS use `export` instead):
   
    SET JRE_HOME=<JRE HOME>
    SET TNS_ADM=<location of tnsnames.ora>
    
Of which `TNS_ADM` is optional unless you need to connect Oracle via tnsnames.ora, or may also refer to `init_sample.cfg` for more settings. An example is:
   
    SET JRE_HOME=d:\soft\java
    SET TNS_ADM=d:\Soft\InstanceClient\network\admin

### Launch DBCLI Console
After the above configurations, you are able to start DBCLI by executing `dbcli.bat` or `bin\ConsoleZ\Console.exe`.

`dbcli.bat` also supports arguments in `"<command>=<args>"` format, all available commands can be found by typing `help` or `help -a`.

For example: `dbcli.bat "connect=tiger/scott@orcl"`



### Switch Database Platform
DBCLI supports multiple database platforms(oracle,mysql,db2,etc), default is `Oracle`.

To permanently change the preferred platform other than `Oracle`, run `set -p platform <platform>` after launching the console. 
For example, `set -p platform db2`

Without the `-p` option, the change only takes affect on current console window. 
Type `set platform` to see all available options.

Command Overview
-----------------------
* **Public Commands: visible in all database platforms**
  * _Instruction_
    * `help` : Show help information,Use `"help <command>"` to show the detail information of other commands, or `"help help"` to see more usage of the `help` command. <br/>The default database platform is `Oracle`, to switch to other platform, use the `"set [-p] platform"` command

Command Types
-----------------------
The command rules are similar to SQL*Plus:
* DDL commands that related to creating source code(`create trigger/package/function/procedure/type`) are cross-lines commands and should be end with `/` in a stand-alone line. `create table/index/etc` are not of this kind because they are related to structures.
* Other DML,DDL,DCL commands are also cross-lines commands that end with either `;`, or `/` in a new line.
* Command `SET COMMAND_ENDMARKS` is used to customize those 2 symbols.
* Apart from the above commands, most of other commands are single line commands and will be executed after the `Enter` key is pressed.
Type `help -a` and refer to the `Cross-lines` field for the type of each command. 

Line Wrap
-----------------------
For the output lines that wider than the buffer width(in Posix System it's the screen width), the overflow part will be trimmed.
To view the complete information:
* use `<command> | less` to enter Linux-style `less` mode, and press `arrow` keys to scroll the screen
* use `less last` to view the last output in `less` mode
* run command `out` to launch the default editor to see the historical output. If the default editor is `vi`, execute `:set nowrap` and use hotkey `e/b/zL/zH` to horizontally scroll the screen.
To change the default editor, use `set [-p] editor <executable name>`. For example, `set editor code`

Color Solutions
-----------------------
`dbcli` has defined some colors that used in different scenario, those colors can be found by `set color`.<br/>
You are able to change the colors by executing `set [-p] <color name> <new code>`, of which the code can be referenced by command `ansi`, and `-p` means permanently.<br/>
For example, `set promptcolor BLU;BWHT;UDL` is to change the prompt color as `Blue Foreground + White Background + Underlined`, and `set promptcolor default` to change as default.<br/>
It's possible to turn of using colors, which is done by executing `set ansicolor off` 

Releases
-----------------------
There are 5 zip files in the `releases` page that used in different scenario, all those releases don't include the `src` directory:
* `dbcli_all.zip`: includes everything
* `dbcli_win.zip`: excludes the `jre_linux` directory and include `JRE 1.8` for `Windows`
* `dbcli_linux.zip`: excludes the `jre` directory and include `JRE 1.8` for `Linux`
* `dbcli_nojre.zip`: excludes the `jre/jre_linux` directories
* `dbcli_oracle_lite.zip`: excludes the `jre/jre_linux/bin/docs` directories, you can remove more sub-directories under `lib` depending on your OS.

Customize Commands
------------------------------------

### Customize new simple commands

You are able to use command `alias` to define the shortcut of the simple command, for instance:<br/>
`alias sf select * from (select * from $*) where rownum<=50;`

In this case, you can execute `sf dba_objects where object_id<1000` to simplify the input.

The `alias` command supports the `$1-$9` and `$*` wildcard characters, of which `$n` corresponds to the `n`th parameter, and `$*` means the concatenation of `$n+1`-`$9` via space. 
Type `alias` to see more usage.
 
### Customize new sub-commands

Similar to SQL*Plus script, a sub-command script is the combination of one or more existing commands that supports user-input parameters.
Take command `ora` for example, to define a sub-command `xxx`, create file `oracle\ora\xxx.sql` and fill with following content: <br/>
`select * from (select * from &V1) where rownum<=50;`

After that, run `ora -r` to take effect, then you can run `ora xxx dba_objects` to query the view.

The utility has created some pre-defined commands, if you want to modify the those commands without concerning of overriding back by the new version, just create a sub-folder under the `ora` directory, and put the updated file into it, because for the scripts with same name, the one in the sub directory will be treated as higher priority. Or you may also use `ora -l <path>` to link to another work dir.

Commands `ora/show/sys/snap/chart/sql/shell/etc` follow the similar rules:
* Parameters: Accept `:V1-:V20` or `&V1-&V20` as the input parameters, of which `:Vn` means binding parameters, and `&Vn` means variable substitution.
* Help comment: `/*[[...]]*/` is optional, as the help or usage information
* Options: `--[[...]]--` inside the help comment is also optional, normally used to specify the command options(i.e., `ora actives -m`) and access validation, refer to other sub-commands for more examples.

### Customize new root commands
Different from sub-commands, the root command must be a lua script. To plug a user-define lua script into the utility, just add its path in `data\plugin.cfg`, you may refer to `data\plugin_sample.cfg` for the example.

Below are the common interfaces that can be used in the script:
*  Define a new command: `env.set_command(...)`
*  Define a new setting: `env.set.init_cfg(...)`
*  Add trigger to an event: `env.snoop('<event_name>', <parameters>)`
*  Get current database: `env.getdb()`

You may also:
* Execute `help -a` or `set -a` or `event` to see how those interfaces are used in other scripts
* Execute `help -e env[.module] 2` to see the available interfaces, i.e.: `help -e env.oracle 2`
